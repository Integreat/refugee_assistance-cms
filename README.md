# Integreat
This is the legacy back end for Integreat. Issues are tracked in https://issues.integreat-app.de/projects/WP/.

## WordPress CMS
We use WordPress to manage and deliver our content.
This is mostly due to the huge community behind it which provides an overwhelming number of already-tested plugins. This saves us a lot of time since one week of coding becomes two clicks of installing and activating the plugin.
